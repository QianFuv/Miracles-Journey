Spring, the Last Falling Leaf by DeepSeek

       The laboratory was a scar left in the fabric of reality, traced inadvertently by His fingertips. Pure white, sterile—its very existence was to hold the ethereal arc of the “Temporal Axis Stabilization Anchor.” Lin Mo was the one He had chosen, the finger to wind the clock.
       It was He who fed the poisoned apple of knowledge into his mind, who guided him to gather materials beyond the world’s rules, and who, across the vast stage of existence, pushed him to complete this machine capable of rewinding time. An experiment? A game? Lin Mo could not know. He only knew that when the message appeared on the screen, he had to press the button.
       “Spring Temporal Point confirmed: Falling Leaf Index (1/1), End of Spring Era. Initiate rollback protocol?”
       Outside, the world froze. Vehicles, light, startled birds—everything suspended like insects in amber. The sky was iron-gray, lifeless; dawn eternally fixed on the instant before it arrived. Spring had died, with the fall of this single leaf.
       His fingertip pressed down.
       “Initiate.”
       Collapse, ripples, rewind… followed by shrill alarms, black screens, and the “sensation” of that immense will being triggered. Then, the paradoxical overlay of countless Lin Mos pressing the button at the machine’s core.
       In the final instant before consciousness stalled, an epiphany struck him like lightning: the loop had formed.
       Absolute stillness descended.
       Sound, motion, thought—all frozen. Lin Mo’s consciousness suspended in the last thought he tried to save, like a droplet of water instantaneously frozen. He became part of this eternal frame, frozen mid-lunge toward the console, trapped in time.
       Upon that substrate of absolute stillness—where even atomic vibrations had ceased—something “moved.”
       Not in motion, but in “defining” motion.
       Its form was indescribable, its mode of existence incomprehensible. It simply “was there,” transcending the frozen temporal structure, like someone standing outside a gallery, gazing at a motionless painting.
       Its gaze—if it could be called that—swept across the frozen tableau. It passed over Lin Mo’s desperate, rigid face, over the machine still jumping between start and reset at infinite frequency, yet macroscopically at the extreme of stillness.
       No anger, no astonishment, not a ripple. Only an absolute, detached indifference, overlooking the dust.
       Then, it “reached out.”
       Not a hand in the physical sense. A conceptual touch, an operation upon existence itself.
       The absolutely still, unyielding temporal structure emitted a silent wail under His “fingertips,” one capable of shattering the soul—if any soul remained. Space cracked like fragile glass; the time axis twisted and ruptured like a string torn from a harp.
       His fingers casually pinched the “Temporal Axis Stabilization Anchor” floating at the center of the lab. That creation, into which Lin Mo had poured endless effort, containing paradoxical power, capable of briefly stalling the logic of the world, became in His hand like a sandcastle built by a child.
       No force was applied.
       Only intention moved.
       The machine, along with the infinitely looping temporal paradox within it, was instantly reduced to the most fundamental particles—without a single spark, without a sound—erased completely from all layers of existence.
       Then, His gaze fell upon the cerulean planet suspended in frozen space-time. On Earth, the last leaf of spring remained in that eternal pose, poised between falling and remaining.
       The same indifference.
       The same “reach.”
       The temporal structure emitted another silent, unbearable fracture. Earth, along with millennia of civilization, life, love and hate, memory and hope, under that incomprehensible might, was crushed like a bubble under a fingertip.
       No explosion, no debris. Only the utter disappearance of existence. A planet, and the frozen time upon it, wiped from the canvas without a trace.
       Having done all this, the existence did not pause—not even a fraction. As if brushing a speck of dust off its shoulder.
       It “withdrew” its hand.
       The shattered temporal structure began to self-repair, following deeper, absolute rules, smoothing all scars, returning to an original balance. Yet within that balance, the universe that had contained spring, the falling leaf, and the scientist named Lin Mo no longer existed.
       Absolute void—or rather, returning to the “emptiness” that had always belonged in His palm.
       And the leaf that had marked the end of spring had, of course, never existed.
