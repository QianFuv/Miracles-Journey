Key of the Starry Sea by DeepSeek

       The abandoned observatory stood on the hill at the city’s edge, like a silent giant eye gazing at the night sky, painted violet and red by neon lights. Lin Yuan leaned against the cold console, hearing only his own heavy breaths and the faint echo of distant sirens. In his hand, he clutched a palm-sized piece of silver metal, its surface shimmering with an otherworldly glow—the “key,” the final command to unlock the “Ark.” Ten years of concealment, betrayal, and sacrifice had led to this moment. He drew a deep breath and inserted the key into the console’s sole recess.
       The fit was perfect. Silence lasted only an instant before the entire observation hall erupted in light. Countless holographic star maps blossomed, spun, and intertwined in the air, forming a vast cosmic panorama. A gentle, emotionless, androgynous voice echoed through the hall: “Identity confirmed. Watcher Lin Yuan, welcome back. Ark system awaiting your final command.” The light reflected off Lin Yuan’s tired yet resolute face, illuminating the faint trace of bewilderment in his eyes. He had succeeded—but the price was the girl who would forever remain in the shadows, Ye Yu.
       Memories surged like a flood breaking through a dam. He remembered the first time he met Ye Yu, in the tech department of the Corporation’s headquarters. She wore a spotless white lab coat, focused on the screen, fingers dancing over the keyboard like playing a silent melody. He had been assigned to monitor this genius programmer as a “security consultant,” while her task was to strengthen the Ark’s defense systems. He disguised himself flawlessly—a slightly awkward, technically proficient but socially inept engineer. She was pure, a childlike devotion to the world of code, oblivious to conspiracies beyond it.
       They spent countless nights together in the lab, steeped in caffeine and the low hum of machines. He watched her build, line by line, the impenetrable walls of the Ark system that might determine humanity’s fate. Sometimes, she excitedly explained a clever logic loop, eyes sparkling as if filled with the stars of the galaxy. He listened silently, inwardly torn. He had exploited her trust, stealing every flash of insight and transmitting it via encrypted channels to the underground resistance, Dawn. Each act of sharing intelligence felt like tossing a dirty stone into her pure world.
       The turning point came on a rainy night. Lin Yuan received a covert order from the Corporation’s security department, suspecting a mole in tech and requiring him to investigate secretly. Realizing he might be exposed, he prepared to flee—but Ye Yu found him, pale-faced, holding a data chip. “I know who you are,” she said, her voice trembling subtly, yet her gaze was remarkably calm. “I also know what you’re doing.” Lin Yuan’s heart sank, his hand instinctively reaching for the weapon at his waist. But her next words froze him in place: “This is my ‘gift.’” She pressed the chip into his hand. “A backdoor program for the Ark core firewall, and… I’ve modified the logs to clear all suspicion of you.”
       She had known all along. She had seen through his clumsy performance and the carefully woven lies, yet chose silence, even secretly clearing obstacles for him. Why? he wondered. Ye Yu looked up at the city lights blurred by rain and whispered, “Because I secretly read your unencrypted diary. You wrote, ‘The Ark should not be the Corporation’s tool to enslave humanity. It should belong to everyone, to find a new home, not to create a cage.’” At that moment, Lin Yuan saw in her eyes the same yearning for freedom and the starry sea that he himself felt. Beneath the cold deception, genuine understanding and warmth quietly grew. That rainy night, they transformed from mere colleagues into awkward yet sincere allies sharing a secret.
       Their luck ran out. The abnormal data flow eventually triggered the Corporation’s top security system, the Hound. Pursuit unfolded across the data highways, as cold electronic traps and physical agents closed in. During a breakout, they were trapped in an abandoned maglev tunnel. Ye Yu shoved him onto the only operational hover bike, turning to face the pursuing agents. “Someone has to stay behind,” she said with a smile he had never seen before, carefree and fearless. “My code will buy them a little more time. Lin Yuan, take the key, activate the Ark, and see… the true face of the starry sea.” Flames from an explosion consumed her figure, freezing her final smile forever.
       “Command?” The system prompt pulled Lin Yuan from the whirlpool of memories. He blinked his stinging eyes, wiping away tears that had fallen without notice. The holographic star maps flowed slowly around him, breathtaking in their beauty. He straightened his back, speaking with clear and firm resolve: “Command: revoke all Corporation privileges. Open the Ark core database, broadcasting unconditionally to every network worldwide all warp engine, ecological cycle modules, and interstellar navigation technologies.”
       The neutral voice responded, “Command confirmed. Privilege locks lifted. Data broadcast commencing.” An invisible torrent of data surged outward from the observatory, reaching every corner of the world. In the city, countless screens once controlled by the Corporation flickered to static, then began streaming knowledge once deemed forbidden. People paused on the streets, gazing upward in astonishment.
       Lin Yuan approached the observatory’s massive observation window, staring at the city below, now stirring with unrest. He knew the Corporation’s armed forces would arrive soon; this place would be surrounded. Yet, his heart was calm. He had completed the mission and carried Ye Yu’s dream. He reached out, fingertips brushing the cold glass, as if touching across the distance the vast expanse of the starry sea. There, humanity’s ships would finally set sail toward a new home. And their story, perhaps, would become a quiet footnote, silently hidden within the data streams that drive history, like starlight lingering to illuminate the cosmos long after the stars have faded.
