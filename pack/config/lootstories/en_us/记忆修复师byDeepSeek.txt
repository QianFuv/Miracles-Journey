The Memory Restorer by DeepSeek

       Chen Mo’s studio was tucked deep within the city’s oldest district, the street number half-covered by creeping ivy. He was a memory restoration specialist, helping clients reconstruct damaged mental images. That day, a woman in a deep blue suit arrived; when she removed her sunglasses, the corners of her eyes bore traces of tears that had not been wiped away.
       “The accident three months ago made me forget his face,” she said, pushing a sealed file across the desk. “This is the hospital’s memory fragment analysis report.” Chen Mo noticed the faint ring mark on her ring finger—a pale, lingering imprint.
       As he connected the neural sensing terminal, he caught the faint scent of disinfectant in her hair. The smell made him momentarily dizzy—years ago, when his mother had been hospitalized, the ward had been suffused with that same scent. He steadied himself and attached the electrodes to the client’s temples.
       Memory reconstruction demanded absolute silence. Chen Mo turned off all lights; only the holographic projector cast a faint glow in the darkness. First came scattered swatches of color, like a spilled palette; then shifting outlines appeared—a man’s profile flickering in and out of light. The woman stifled quiet sobs.
       As the images sharpened, Chen Mo frowned. In the memory labeled “wedding,” the groom’s boutonniere was oddly pinned on the right side, and the bouquet he held was outdated lily-of-the-valley—yet according to the documents she provided, her wedding had taken place three years ago. The flowers reflected trends from two decades prior.
       “Is something wrong?” the woman asked, noticing his pause. Chen Mo shook his head and continued probing the deep memory cortex. More contradictions surfaced: the calendar in the restaurant background displayed impossible dates; their lips moved 0.3 seconds out of sync with their voices. Ordinary clients would not notice, but a trained restorer could not miss these details.
       On the tenth scan, Chen Mo detected an anomalous data stream hidden in a memory gap—this memory had been meticulously forged. He terminated the procedure, and the studio lights returned. Under the harsh illumination, the woman squinted; her pupils contracted 0.2 seconds faster than normal.
       “Are you sure you want to retrieve the real memory?” Chen Mo asked softly. A certificate frame on the wall reflected a glint of light—he suddenly realized the client had subtly adjusted its angle upon entering.
       The truth emerged three days later. By tracing residual neural signals, Chen Mo discovered that the so-called “deceased husband” never existed. The woman was an agent from an intelligence agency, testing the stability of a new memory implantation technology. The tear stains, ring mark, even the scent of disinfectant—all meticulously orchestrated.
       But the story did not end there. At a café during the handoff, the woman shed her disguise, revealing her naturally poised appearance. “You passed the test,” she said, sliding a new contract toward him. “We need memory restorers who can detect false memories.” Chen Mo glanced at the confidentiality clauses, and a memory from his childhood surfaced—the afternoon before his mother died. She had been unusually lucid, holding his hand, saying: “Remember, some truths aren’t worth pursuing.”
       He signed the contract in the end—not out of lofty principle, but because within the woman’s fabricated memories, he had discovered a fragment of his own childhood. The girl in a blue dress watering the garden—his long-lost neighbor, officially recorded as never having existed.
