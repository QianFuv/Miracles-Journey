TheBookstore in the Rain by ChatGPT

       Night hung low, and the neon at the street corner blurred into a flowing haze through the rain. Puddles on the sidewalk reflected the dim streetlights, like crumpled sheets of old gold foil. Gu Chen held an umbrella and walked to the small bookstore nearly swallowed by time—“Huaiyu Bookstore.”
       The weathered wooden sign above the door bore barely legible characters, eroded by years of rain.
       As he pushed the door open, the bell rang softly, carrying the scent of old dust and paper. Behind the counter sat an elderly man with white hair, wiping a cracked teacup. He glanced up at Gu Chen and smiled gently. “Raining again, isn’t it?”
       “Yes,” Gu Chen replied, setting down his umbrella and brushing off the droplets from his shoulders. It had been three years since he last came—ever since that departure without farewell.
       The bookshelves still held their almost chaotic order. Philosophy texts leaned against fairy tales, poetry collections slipped between cookbooks, as if all the words found temporary shelter here.
       Gu Chen reached for the familiar *Night Wanderer’s Notes*. The spine was still cracked, though the cover had gathered a thin layer of new dust.
       “You still like this one,” the old man said, rising slowly and placing the teacup back on the counter. “That girl liked it too, back then.”
       Gu Chen’s fingers trembled slightly. The sound of rain seemed to grow clearer, like a silent question.
       “Later… she…” Gu Chen faltered, his words dissolving into the misty air.
       “She sent a letter,” the old man whispered, “saying she was going north to see the aurora. She asked me to leave a message for you.”
       Gu Chen looked up, a flicker of light stirring in his eyes.
       “She said—if one day you return, make sure to check whether this book has been taken by anyone.”
       Gu Chen’s throat tightened. He lowered his gaze to the old book. Rainwater dripped from the umbrella’s edge, like tears of time.
       He closed the book gently and handed it to the old man. “Then I’ll take it with me.”
       The old man nodded silently, offering only a knowing smile that seemed to understand everything.
       Stepping out of the bookstore, the rain continued to fall. Gu Chen left his umbrella behind, letting the cold rain soak his hair. Under the streetlights, he felt as if he had walked into an unfinished dream, and at the end of that dream, perhaps, a faint aurora shimmered quietly.
