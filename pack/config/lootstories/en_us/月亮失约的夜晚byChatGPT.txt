The Night the Moon Failed to Appear by ChatGPT

       That night, the moon did not show. The entire town felt muted, as if someone had pressed a silence button; only the wind whispered between the eaves. Lin Que sat on the stone steps by the river, a paper lantern flickering weakly at his feet.
       Every year he came to release a lantern—for the girl who would never return. The townsfolk said he had lost his mind, or that he could not forget. But he knew he was simply keeping a promise: when the moon rose, she would come back.
       The river was cold, carrying the snow from distant mountains. Lin Que took out a small box from his chest, inside it the silver hairpin, shaped like a crescent moon. Years ago, she had laughed and said, “When I’ve seen the world outside, I’ll use this to tell you I’ve come back.”
       The lantern flickered, like a heart about to extinguish. Lin Que looked up at the sky; clouds thick as a wall hid all hope behind them.
       “Tonight, I suppose we are delayed again,” he muttered with a self-deprecating smile.
       Suddenly, the wind stopped. The river lay in silence. In that instant, a sliver of light slipped through the clouds, gently touching the water. It was not the white of the moon, but a faint silver-blue, a color one might only see in dreams.
       Lin Que froze. The paper lantern was nudged by a gentle breeze, drifting downstream, floating in the light. In that moment, he seemed to see a blurry figure at the far end of the river, turning to smile.
       “You’ve finally come,” he whispered, his voice carried away by the wind, merging with the night.
       The clouds closed again, the light vanished. Lin Que lowered his gaze to the river, left only with a few tender ripples.
       He did not light another lantern, nor did he wait. He simply sat in quiet, until the faint glow of dawn appeared in the east.
       After that day, the townsfolk said Lin Que no longer released lanterns. When asked if he had finally let go, he only smiled and replied, “She has already come back.”
