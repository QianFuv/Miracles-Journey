The Wind Paused in Willow Alley by ChatGPT

       The afternoon wind carried the scent of osmanthus, drifting slowly from the depths of the old alley. White walls and blue tiles lined the stone pavement, strewn with golden fallen leaves. Shen Qi walked slowly, cradling a small wooden box—the last thing her mother had left behind.
       Willow Alley was short, yet it gave the illusion that time moved slower here. She remembered, as a child, her mother often brought her here to buy osmanthus cakes. At the end of the alley, the shop’s door always hung a string of wind chimes that jingled merrily—soundtracking her childhood.
       Now the shop had long been abandoned. The door panels were weathered, and the sign reading “Asheng Pastry” had nearly been swallowed by the years. Shen Qi crouched down, gently brushing her fingers over the old wooden sign, as if caressing a fragment of long-buried tenderness.
       “Miss, are you looking for someone?” a frail voice called from behind.
       She turned to see an elderly man leaning on a cane, his face gentle. Shen Qi nodded. “My mother worked here as a pastry chef when she was young. I just… wanted to see the place where she spent her days.”
       The old man paused for a moment, then smiled. “You’re Asheng’s daughter, aren’t you? She spoke of you often, said your smile was like a crescent moon.”
       Shen Qi froze, her eyes misting. She took a yellowed piece of paper from the box—a recipe her mother had left behind. In the corner, in tiny handwriting, it read: *“Steam osmanthus cakes when the wind softens.”*
       “She said that when the wind stops, the fragrance lingers longer,” Shen Qi whispered.
       The old man sighed, reaching into his coat to pull out a small key, which he handed to her. “I’ve watched over the shop for her all these years. Perhaps it’s time to let the wind in again.”
       Shen Qi accepted the key and pushed open the heavy wooden door. Dust swirled in the sunlight, and the air still carried a lingering sweetness. She slowly approached the old table, fingertips tracing the worn knife marks, as if she could hear her mother laughing while kneading dough and dusting flour.
       She took out the recipe, reading each step softly. Gradually, the wind slipped through the door gap, and the chimes at the alley’s end jingled once more.
       In that moment, Shen Qi suddenly understood—the wind had never really left. It had merely waited, for someone to remember the fragrance of Willow Alley.
