Monkey King's Divine RodLion Camel Ridge's Demise by DeepSeek

       As the monk Tang Sanzang and his disciples journeyed west, they came upon the dreaded Lion Camel Ridge. The Monkey King leaped into the air, his golden eyes piercing through the illusions that shrouded the mountain. Below stretched a landscape of corruption: demonic clouds choked the horizon for miles, malignant energies coiled upward from eight directions. The hillsides were honeycombed with caves like an anthill, swarming with monstrous creatures scuttling like cockroaches.
       Within the main cavern dwelled three demon kings. The eldest had once swallowed a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers whole. The second wielded a trunk that could ensnare sea dragons. The third spread black wings that blotted out sun and moon. Across eight hundred subsidiary caves, forty-seven thousand lesser demons stood ready, sharpening their fangs and licking their lips in anticipation of the immortal flesh that approached.
       Monkey pondered the situation. "In a straight fight, I wouldn't fear any of them. But these cursed creatures are numerous, and if they swarm us, our master might be terrified. It'd mean endless trouble and delay our journey. Better to use my powers and wipe them out completely, roots and all!"
       An idea came to him. "Change!" he cried. His Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod, that once served Yu the Great as an anchor that calmed the seas, weighing thirteen thousand five hundred pounds, instantly shrank until it was fine as an embroidery needle. "Good treasure," Monkey chuckled, "today we'll try something new!"
       Mustering his divine power, he shouted "Go!" and flung the needle skyward. It didn't travel outward but upward, spinning as it pierced the clouds, climbing until it reached five hundred and ten yards overhead—a tiny star visible against the blue day.
       As the saying goes, "Heaven has its paths, earth its doors." Having reached its apex, the treasure reversed course. It turned precisely, perfectly aligned with the main peak of Lion Camel Ridge, then fell like a meteor chasing the moon. Because it had been made so small, it disturbed neither wind nor cloud, falling silently yet swift as lightning, a golden streak that plunged directly into the mountain's spine.
       The action was quicker than words can tell. A faint "shhh" sounded, like silk tearing, like brocade pierced. The treasure passed through countless yards of solid rock as if it were nothing, drilling deep into the earth—two thousand yards down to the very lungs of the mountain. Though Monkey had made his staff tiny, it retained its power to split mountains and shatter stone.
       Seeing the moment had come, Monkey made hand signs and chanted spells, crying "Grow! Lengthen! Thicken!"
       What followed defied description. Deep underground, golden lotus flowers seemed to bloom as the nine underworlds trembled, startling gods and ghosts alike. The treasure, fine as a wheat awn moments before, instantly resumed its true form—twenty feet long and as thick as a rice bowl, then swelled further to thirty feet around, like a pillar propping up heaven, a golden beam bridging the seas.
       This expansion proved catastrophic, as if Mount Tai had been thrust into the earth's crust. The very world seemed to remake itself as mountains shook and earth split, stones flew and sand whirled, troubling spirits and alarming deities. The entire Lion Camel Ridge boiled like water in a cauldron, tossed like beans on a winnowing basket. Eight hundred demon caves collapsed instantly; forty-seven thousand demons were reduced to flying ash. The local mountain gods cried for their parents, while King Yama and Ksitigarbha stumbled on level ground. The white dragon horse reared in terror, Marshal Tianpeng (now Zhu Bajie) covered his head and dropped flat. As for the three demon kings—despite their heaven-swallowing trunk and sea-stirring wings—they had no chance to use their powers before they, their cave, and everything around them were crushed to dust beneath their own mountain.
       Zhu Bajie stared, jaw slack, then dropped his rake and prostrated himself. "Brother! What technique is this? Not your usual staff work, but heaven-shaking magic!"
       Monkey recalled his staff and laughed. "What would you know, oaf? They say 'don't use an ox-cleaver to kill a chicken,' but today I used exactly that—not to chop, but to let it take root in their very foundations and burst their guts! This is called 'removing the firewood from under the cauldron'—efficient and tidy."
       Sandy clasped his hands together. "Truly a master plan! It harmed no innocent creatures nearby, yet destroyed the evil ones and ended the threat forever."
       As they spoke, Lion Camel Ridge subsided into a massive crater. The disciples gathered their belongings and continued west without pausing. Thus they journeyed onward:
       With cunning and magic heaven and earth aided,
       The golden hoop's compliance conquered demon spirits.
       Calamity dispelled, they reached pure land,
       Westward they traveled to behold sacred wisdom.
