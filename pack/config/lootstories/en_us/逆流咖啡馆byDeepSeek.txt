Reverse Café by DeepSeek

       Shen Qing pushed open the heavy wooden door of the café. The wind chime did not ring. She noticed a thin layer of dust on the bell, as if no one had touched it for ages. Inside, only an old man sat in the corner, stirring a cup of dark coffee whose liquid swirled counterclockwise.
       “New here?” the old man asked without looking up. His voice came as if from a distance, carrying a strange echo. Shen Qing hesitated, then nodded, sitting at the counter. She was supposed to be at an interview, yet some unseen force had guided her into this alley she had never noticed before.
       The cup the owner handed her had no saucer, and its walls were unusually cold. She sipped, and the bitterness exploded on her tongue. Through the window, she saw clouds drifting backward—not pushed by the wind, but truly moving from east to west.
       “Time here…” Shen Qing’s voice trembled. The old man had silently moved beside her, his wrinkled fingers tracing circles along the rim of the cup. “Every newcomer is startled,” he said. “But soon, you will get used to it.”
       Shen Qing wanted to leave but found the view outside had changed—the narrow alley transformed into a golden wheat field, stalks reverting from ripe gold to fresh green at a visible speed. She stepped back into the café, and the alley returned.
       “Don’t rush to go.” The owner wiped a cup slowly, so slowly that every contraction of his muscles could be observed. “Finish this coffee, and you will know what you are meant to know.”
       Shen Qing forced herself to calm down. She noticed the wall clock, its hands swinging back and forth between three and four, never reaching the next number. A small puddle had formed at the bottom of the old man’s cup, but the water was rising, creeping back up to the rim.
       “Am I the first to come here?” Shen Qing asked.
       The owner and the old man exchanged a glance, smiling mysteriously. “You are the first to ask that,” the old man said. “The others either panic or assume they have gone mad.”
       As she drained the coffee, Shen Qing noticed more anomalies: her watch’s hands running backward, her once-pristine clothing now dusted with the alley’s dirt, and even the taste of her breakfast gradually replaced by last night’s dinner.
       “Time here flows backward,” the owner finally explained. “From the moment you pushed the door, your timeline began to flow in reverse. But don’t worry, it will return to normal once you leave.”
       Shen Qing felt a dizzy spell. She watched the old man slowly grow younger—wrinkles vanished, white hair turned black. “He is a regular here,” the owner said. “He prefers to live in reversed time just to see lost loved ones again.”
       “And you?” Shen Qing asked. “Why don’t you leave?”
       The owner was silent for a moment, rolling up his sleeves. His arms were covered in fine cracks, like porcelain broken and pieced together. “I tried to leave,” he said, “but time has remembered me.”
       Shen Qing suddenly understood: this café was a temporal rift, sheltering those who wished to start over. But each reverse left irreversible traces on its dwellers.
       When the last drop of coffee vanished, Shen Qing stood. She no longer feared the changes outside, knowing that some choices, once made, were meant to be remembered by time, not undone.
       As she pushed the door open, the wind chime finally rang—a crisp sound, like a sigh of time, returning her to the original world. She was late for the interview, but in her hand was a slip of paper with an address: “If you wish to start over, we are always here.”
       Shen Qing tore the paper and threw it into a nearby trash can. The fragments floated back into her hand, reassembling into the complete slip.
