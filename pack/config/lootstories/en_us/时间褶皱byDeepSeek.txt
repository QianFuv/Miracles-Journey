Temporal Folds by DeepSeek

       Lin Yuan woke to find the hands of his bedside clock moving backward. He slapped it hard; the minute hand shivered, jumped two ticks, and continued its reverse journey. Outside the window, a sparrow flapped its wings, flying from the ground back to the branch, the whole scene playing like a video in reverse.
       He stumbled into the bathroom. Water surged up from the drain, falling precisely back into the faucet. His reflection in the mirror was blurred, as if seen through frosted glass. Lin Yuan reached out to touch it, but his fingertips met coldness—not glass, but something metallic.
       His phone displayed no service. Pushing open his front door, the street was empty, save for cars repeating their backward motions and leaves swirling in reverse. He tried to call out, but his voice seemed swallowed by something, leaving no echo behind.
       At the end of the street, he encountered the first “normal” person. The figure wore a silver-gray uniform and held a device resembling a tablet. “Resident Lin Yuan of Sector 734, please follow me.” The voice was calm, emotionless. Lin Yuan noticed the uniform bore no creases, perfectly smooth as if freshly ironed.
       They arrived at an unremarkable building, the entrance bare of signage. Inside, the space was astonishingly vast, countless screens displaying streams of complex data. “This is the Time Management Bureau,” the silver-uniformed figure said. “A temporal fold has occurred in your sector. Like a crease in fabric, time here is folded and reversed.”
       Lin Yuan struggled to digest the information. “Why me? Why here?”
       “Every temporal fold requires an anchor.” The figure pointed to one screen showing a live feed of Lin Yuan’s apartment. “And you are the anchor of this fold.”
       In the days that followed, Lin Yuan learned to live within the reversed flow of time. He discovered he could exert limited control—focusing his attention could temporarily restore normal time in a small area. A withered flower blossomed again under his gaze, only to wither once more.
       The silver-uniformed figure—now Lin Yuan knew him as Chen Shi—began teaching finer manipulations. “Time is not linear; it’s a superposition of countless possibilities.” Chen Shi’s fingers glided over the console, displaying branching timelines. “Folds occur when a critical node malfunctions.”
       During training, Lin Yuan noticed odd details. Chen Shi’s watch hands never moved; cafeteria staff never spoke, mechanically repeating their tasks; throughout the facility, he was the only “resident of a folded sector.”
       One late night, Lin Yuan sneaked into the area marked “Restricted.” There, he discovered a shocking truth: rows of sleeping pods, each containing a person—and one of them was himself. A label read: “Subject 734, Patient with Temporal Perception Anomaly.”
       Chen Shi appeared silently behind him. “So you’ve found out,” he said, still calm. “There is no Time Management Bureau. This is a neuroscience research facility. Your perception of reversed time is merely a hallucination caused by damage to the brain’s time-perception centers.”
       Lin Yuan pointed to the pods. “Then what about these?”
       “They are treatment devices,” Chen Shi explained. “Simulating temporal anomalies to help patients reconstruct normal time perception.”
       But as Chen Shi spoke, Lin Yuan noticed a detail: a crease had formed on the edge of his uniform—a first imperfection in this “perfect” environment.
       Lin Yuan laughed. “If what you say is true, why is your uniform creased? In a place where everything is so meticulously controlled?”
       Chen Shi’s expression faltered for the first time.
       “Because,” Lin Yuan said slowly, “you are part of this fold too, aren’t you?”
       The space began to quake, walls peeling like paper, revealing intricate machinery beneath. Lin Yuan realized this place was neither a time bureau nor a research facility—it was part of a larger system. And he may never have been an ordinary resident caught by accident.
       As the last disguise fell away, the console screen flashed: “System self-check… Cycle 734… Locating exit protocol…”
       Chen Shi—or rather, the entity assuming his form—stood silently before him. “Congratulations,” it said, “you are the first anchor to uncover the truth.”
       “So,” Lin Yuan asked, “what now?”
       “Now,” Chen Shi’s figure began to fade, “it’s your turn to guide, to find the next anchor capable of seeing through the truth.”
       When Lin Yuan opened his eyes again, he wore a silver-gray uniform, standing before a door. Inside, a confused man was slapping a clock rotating counterclockwise.
