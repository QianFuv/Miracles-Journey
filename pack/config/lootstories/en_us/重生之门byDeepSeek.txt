The Gate of Rebirth by DeepSeek

       Li Ming stood at the end of the hospital corridor. Outside, the city glittered with countless lights, but his heart was shrouded in darkness. The doctor’s words echoed in his mind: “Terminal, at most three months.” He was only thirty-five, his career just beginning, the blueprint of his life barely unfolding—yet fate had mercilessly sentenced him to death.
       Back in his cold apartment, Li Ming began sorting through his belongings. On the lowest shelf of his bookcase, he found an old diary from his high school days. Opening the yellowed pages, he glimpsed a completely different version of himself—a boy who dreamed of becoming a painter and saw the world with boundless curiosity. He had once mocked that innocence, but now, within those naive words, he rediscovered a passion long lost.
       That night, Li Ming could not sleep. He asked himself: if life truly had only three months left, why live for the expectations of others? By morning, he had made a wild decision—to abandon treatment and spend his remaining days seeking the boy he had forgotten. He resigned from work, gave up his apartment, and set off with a backpack on the train to the northwest.
       On the vast Gobi desert, he saw the stars for the first time. The Milky Way cascaded like a waterfall, and the fame, status, and material pursuits he once treasured seemed so insignificant against the cosmos. He settled in a remote village, learning pottery from the elders each day. The feel of clay flowing through his fingers reminded him of the joy of shaping clay figures in art class as a child.
       His body weakened day by day, but his spirit grew fuller. He began to paint—not for exhibitions or sale, but to capture the world he saw: dew-laden wildflowers in the morning, herds of sheep returning at dusk, the pure smiles of children. The villagers knew nothing of his past; to them, he was just an artist from the city. This simplicity brought him a long-forgotten peace.
       In his final month, he completed a series of paintings titled *Rebirth*. They were not about death, but about the smallest, most exquisite beauties in life. He gave the works to the villagers with one request: “Remember, this is the world as seen through the eyes of someone who truly lived.” One tranquil evening, he sat beneath the “Gate of Rebirth” he had built—a simple arch woven from branches and wildflowers—and quietly closed his eyes.
       A year later, Li Ming’s diary and paintings were compiled and published by friends. The book, *The Gate of Rebirth*, unexpectedly moved countless readers. What they saw was not the shadow of death, but the brilliance of life. As he wrote on the final page: “I once thought I was waiting for death, only to realize I was finally learning how to live.”
